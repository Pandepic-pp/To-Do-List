# React Todo List App

This is a simple to-do list app built with React.js and TailwindCSS. It allows you to create notes and delete them individually. I made this app so that I could test my problem-solving, knowledge of react.js and tailwind.css.

## Features

- **Create Notes:** Click the "Create Note" button to add an empty note at the top of the list.
- **Edit Notes:** Each note is represented by a textarea where you can input text.
- **Delete Notes:** Click the "Trash" icon beside each note to remove it from the list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pandepic-pp/To-Do-List.git

2. Go to the repository:

   ```bash
   cd To-Do-List

3. Install all the dependencies along with tailwindCSS. Since this react app is created using vite, you can install TailwindCSS using this website [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-tailwindcss-in-react/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-tailwindcss-in-react/)

   ```bash
   npm i

4. Now, you can run the app with following command:
